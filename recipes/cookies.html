        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            
            <h3>Note:</h3>

                <p><h4><em>This dough requires chilling.</em></h4></p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Place melted butter in the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or large bowl if you're using a hand mixer. Add granulated
                    and brown sugars, and mix on low until mixture is smooth. Mix in egg and vanilla extract on medium speed until combined.
                </li>
                <li>Lightly stir together baking soda, salt and flour in a seperate bowl and spoon the flour mixture into your stand mixer bowl on 
                    low speed until combined. <strong>Be sure to stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl during mixing. Then slowly mix in chocolate chips.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and scoop two tablespoon balls of dough onto the cookie sheet, loosely cover with plastic wrap
                    and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or, freeze for 30 minutes. 
                        <strong>Note:</strong>
                            <em>Spacing does not matter as we are only chilling the dough.</em>
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven 350 degrees fahrenheit, line a second cookie sheet with parchment paper then remove dough from the refrigerator. 
                </li>
                <li>Space cookie dough balls 2 inches apart on the cookie sheets. Bake for 11-15 minutes, or until the edges are a light golden brown and the
                    tops are no longer glossy.
                </li>
                <li>Let cool on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes and then transfer to a baking rack or plate and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
