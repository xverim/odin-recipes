        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Turn stove top on to medium high heat and place skillet, put bacon slices into pan and cook until golden and crispy. 
                    (8-10 Mintutes) You can cook the bacon to your preferred doneness
                    however I feel like the crispy bacon works better on the sandwich.
